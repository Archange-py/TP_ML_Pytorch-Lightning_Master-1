# TP of Machine Learning with Pytorch Lightning for Master 1

###
Welcome ! This directory contains [Laurent Risser](http://laurent.risser.free.fr)'s practical exercises, originally written in pytorch, which I have been implemented in pytorch lightning with python. 
They are the result of work carried out during the second week of the Seconde course, at IMT (Institut de MathÃ©matiques de Toulouse).

## General Info
***

Lightning is a library descended from Pytorch. It retains its object-oriented writing style, but in which model training is automatically managed. If you want to get to the bottom of this, you'll need a good knowledge of object-oriented programming.

> I recommend that you use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) to run Jupiter Notebooks and thus be able to use a GPU or TPU for free.

## Packages
***

You will need to install differently python packages:  
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/install/) :
```
pip install numpy
```
* [Matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/) :
```
pip install matplotlib
```
* [Pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas) :
```
pip install pandas
```
* [Torch](https://pypi.org/project/torch/) :
```
pip install torch
```
* [Torchvision](https://pypi.org/project/torchvision/) :
```
pip install torchvision
```
* [Lightning](https://pypi.org/project/lightning/) :
```
pip install lightning
```

## Google Colab
***

To use a Jupiter Notebook in Google Colab, Lightning needs to be installed directly on the Notebook. Type this command on the first line of your Notebooks in a separate cell :  
```
!pip install lightning -qq
```
